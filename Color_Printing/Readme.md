A non-shiny app code for deconstructing RGB images into their individual colors using an ImageJ macro, and then an R script that provides the output field coordinate file for printing the RGB image using 3 color dyes as a 72x72 image. 

Note:
* the code is highly rudimentary and may need major tweaking, unlike the shiny apps provided in this repository. 
* the output coordinate field file will require a signature line to be manually appended to the bottom of the file before being fed to the pico printer.
